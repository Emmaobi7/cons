### KNOWN BUGS
* The text formatting in the blogs is awful i know(no loud am).
* security: the api could be better secure
* Feel free to find the next bug.


### IMPROVEMENTS

* Using mailChimp or any external email service provider that suits our need
* The pricing table page is not set at all (except it tells you the price which i think is fair (: ))
* Lots of uncessary javascrip runing making our service slow (we're sorry (: ))
